# Vibe Check: Archetypes Overview
*Four primary archetypes, twelve combo types, six mirror pairs*

---

## 1. Core Principle

**Your primary** = what you're about. **Your secondary** = your flavour.

That's it. Primary is your arena, secondary is your tool. A Pulse/Lore person shows up socially but brings knowledge. A Lore/Pulse person gathers knowledge but presents it to groups. Same DNA, different energy.

## 2. The Four Primary Archetypes

| Archetype | Emoji | Color | Hangout | Tagline |
|-----------|-------|-------|---------|---------|
| Pulse | ⚡ | #EC4899 | The Rooftop | You bring the energy |
| Glow | 🔥 | #22C55E | The Pitch | You don't stop |
| Cozy | 🕯️ | #F97316 | The Hearth | You make people feel at home |
| Lore | 📚 | #3B82F6 | The Lobby | You go deep |

**Pulse**  - The spark. You thrive on social energy, new connections, and momentum. Everything around you feels like it's about to pop off.

**Glow**  - The drive. You're always leveling up - fitness, side hustles, yourself. Growth is how you connect with people.

**Cozy**  - The warmth. Real conversations, good vibes, being someone's safe space. You read people like a book and people trust that.

**Lore**  - The depth. You go deep on the things you care about. Obsession is your love language, and you respect anyone who does the same.
