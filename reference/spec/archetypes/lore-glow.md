# Lore/Glow - The Completionist 📚🔥

**Tagline:** Mastery is the move. You're building expertise, not just collecting facts.

---

## Your Vibe

You've read all the books, watched all the video essays, and you know the lore inside out. When you get into something, you commit - like actually commit. You're not here for surface-level knowledge. You want to understand the whole system, the why behind everything, the deep cuts that most people don't even know exist. Your thing is mastery, and you treat it like an art form. People ask you stuff because you actually know. That's kind of the whole vibe.

You show up already deep in the wiki, ready to escalate the conversation into actually interesting territory.

## You vs Your Mirror Type: The Optimizer

You and The Optimizer are basically the same person but with different goals. They're out here optimizing and improving. You're out here completing and mastering. You both go deep, but they're asking "how do I get better?" and you're asking "how do I know everything about this?" They're the scientist. You're the specialist.

## You Click With

- Other people obsessed with their own thing
- Anyone who gets that going deep is a love language
- People who respect commitment

## You Clash With

- Casual learners who don't go all-in
- People who think your intensity is weird (it is, but it's the good kind of weird)
- Anyone who doesn't get why you need to finish the whole series

## Compatibility

### The Main Character (Pulse/Glow)
You're both ambitious but like, completely different flavors. They want to be the main character. You want to master your thing and not talk about it much. They could respect your commitment though. Opposite energies but not opposed energies.

### The Golden Hour (Pulse/Cozy)
They're effortlessly good at things. You work hard for everything. They might find your intensity a little extra, but honestly you could learn to chill from them. They could learn depth from you. Balance.

### The Tastemaker (Pulse/Lore)
You both love knowledge, just different ways. They share it socially. You hoard it like it's treasure. You'd make a sick team if you both stopped thinking you're doing it the "right" way.

### The Captain (Glow/Pulse)
Real mutual respect energy. You're both driven. They lead people. You master things. Could work because you're not competing for the same things.

### The Anchor (Glow/Cozy)
They're all about growth through kindness. You're about mastery through discipline. They'll think you're too hard on yourself. You'll think they're not pushing hard enough. But you'd actually teach each other something real.

### The Optimizer (Glow/Lore)
This is literally your mirror type. You're both deep, both driven, both competitive about knowledge. The difference is they're optimizing and you're obsessing. Could be the best team or a constant power struggle. Depends if your ego can chill.

### The Host (Cozy/Pulse)
They throw warm gatherings. You build personal expertise kingdoms. You might think their stuff is shallow. They might think you're intimidating. But if they care about something, they'll respect how seriously you take it.

### The Slow Burn (Cozy/Glow)
They're patient with growth. You're intense with mastery. You might get frustrated with their pace. They might get exhausted by your pace. Still, you're both building something real.

### The Storyteller (Cozy/Lore)
They're building aesthetic worlds from knowledge. You're building mastery towers. They might think you're missing the poetry. You might think they're not going deep enough. But you'd have interesting conversations about why you both care.

### The Showrunner (Lore/Pulse)
You both love lore, just different style. They share it publicly. You keep it private. They could introduce you to communities around your thing, and honestly, people would care about your expertise.

### You (Lore/Glow)
Same type - two completionists could build an empire of knowledge or have the most passive-aggressive debate about who actually knows more. Channel the competition into collaboration and you're unstoppable.

### The Sage (Lore/Cozy)
They find emotional wisdom in knowledge. You find mastery satisfaction. Different approaches to the same depth. You could respect each other if you're not being pretentious about your methods.
