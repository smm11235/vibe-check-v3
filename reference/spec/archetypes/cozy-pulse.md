# Cozy/Pulse  - The Host 🕯️⚡

**Tagline:** You make everyone feel like they actually belong.

## Your Vibe

You're the one throwing the dinner party, lighting the candles, somehow knowing exactly what people need before they ask. Your superpower is making spaces feel safe. You're generous with your time and your energy and your emotional real estate. You just invite people in. You turn moments into experiences. Your friends text you when they need to feel held. You're the gathering. The hearth. You understand that comfort isn't luxury - it's intention and presence.

## At The Hearth

You arrived early, lit the candles, and convinced everyone that sitting on the floor is actually the move.

## Compatibility

### The Main Character (Pulse/Glow)
You create the safe haven. They're the main plot. They'll love having your space to recharge. They'll make your gathering feel alive. Just know - they might see your dinner party as a pit stop, not a destination. They're always looking forward.

### The Golden Hour (Pulse/Cozy)
This is your mirror. Mirrors are either perfect or impossible. You both get warmth and belonging. You'll understand each other's assignment. Just make sure you're both giving and receiving - don't both expect the other to do all the emotional labor.

### The Tastemaker (Pulse/Lore)
They bring knowledge to your gathering. That's their love language. They'll make the perfect playlist. You'll make it meaningful. You create something special together. Just catch them if they talk at people instead of with them.

### The Captain (Glow/Pulse)
Captains are always moving. You represent the rest they don't let themselves take. They'll respect how you hold space. You might find them pushy. They might find you slow. But you need each other - they need permission to pause.

### The Anchor (Glow/Cozy)
Both comfort-driven but different paths. You get each other's softness immediately. They might gently challenge you to grow. You'll remind them rest doesn't need to be earned. This has real potential.

### The Optimizer (Glow/Lore)
You're both trying to make things better but different things. They're optimizing for efficiency. You're optimizing for warmth. They might see your rituals as inefficient. You might see their optimization as missing the poetry of just being.

### You (Cozy/Pulse)
You're the same person - mirrors. Either perfect or frustrating. You'll understand each other's assignment with belonging and warmth. Just make sure you're not both doing all the work. Celebrate each other.

### The Slow Burn (Cozy/Glow)
Kindred spirits who both believe in comfort. They're climbing while you're creating refuge. You'll get each other's intentionality. They might use your space as a launchpad. That's okay - that's just who they are.

### The Storyteller (Cozy/Lore)
The coziest pairing. You both build worlds through taste and intention. Your dinner party is their aesthetic. Just watch - don't become so insular together that you forget to let new people in.

### The Showrunner (Lore/Pulse)
They're always in motion. You provide the grounding they need. There's friction - your intentionality vs. their spontaneity. But that balance could be beautiful if you agree on what control means to you both.

### The Completionist (Lore/Glow)
They're deep in their own world mastering things. They might not naturally gather. But if you get them to your dinner, they'll appreciate the ritual. Challenge is - they're often in their headspace, not present. Patience needed.

### The Sage (Lore/Cozy)
Another warm pairing. The Sage brings emotional wisdom in a way you'll feel seen by. You'll have real conversations. You'll understand each other. Just don't endlessly reflect each other - stay curious and open.
