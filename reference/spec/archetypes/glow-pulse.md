# Glow/Pulse - The Captain 🔥⚡

**Tagline:** The person who makes ambition feel like a group project.

---

## Your Vibe

You're the one who starts a running club and it becomes a movement. You see a goal and immediately think about who you need in the room to make it happen. Winning matters - but not if you're alone at the finish line.

People feel like they're part of something bigger just by being around you. You're not managing anyone - you're enlisting them. Your study groups actually study. Your squads actually show up. You're ambitious AND generous, which is rare. You want to bring people up with you.

## At The Pitch

Already planning the strategy and making sure the team is bought in.

## You vs Your Mirror Type: The Main Character

You flip The Main Character's whole thing. They bring competition to the party - you bring the party to the competition. Same electric drive, totally different direction. You build teams, they build vibes.

## Compatibility

### The Main Character (Pulse/Glow)

Magnetic pair with competing energy. You're pointing your drive in different directions - they win the social game, you win at goals. If you align, you're a power couple. Watch for competing over who's leading.

### The Golden Hour (Pulse/Cozy)

Complementary in the best way. You're driving toward something, they're making sure everyone feels good. You're vision, they're heart. Balanced, you're a dream team.

### The Tastemaker (Pulse/Lore)

Both driven, different speeds and methods. They know what's good, you know what to do. Respect their method - they're gathering intelligence, not getting distracted.

### You (Glow/Pulse)

Same type with redundancy risk or power. You could be unstoppable or competing for the same role. Make sure you want the same goal, not just the position.

### The Anchor (Glow/Cozy)

Kindred spirits different paces. You're sprinting, they're jogging. Both get there, just differently. Respect their pace - they're not lazy, they're sustainable.

### The Optimizer (Glow/Lore)

Both driven toward mastery, different methods. They research the path, you build the team to walk it. You need each other - they make sure strategy is sound, you make sure it happens.

### The Host (Cozy/Pulse)

Different arenas. They're gathering people into spaces, you're gathering people toward goals. Watch for misunderstanding what they value - it's not unambitious, just different.

### The Slow Burn (Cozy/Glow)

Both warm, both into growth, you're just faster. You might seem intense to them, they might seem like they're procrastinating. Respect their sustainability.

### The Storyteller (Cozy/Lore)

Very different paces and purposes. You're moving fast toward goals, they're going deep into meaning. Low compatibility unless one of you meets halfway.

### The Showrunner (Lore/Pulse)

Both driven by passion, different expressions. They geek out, you organize people. Watch for dismissing their analysis as overthinking - it's deepening.

### The Completionist (Lore/Glow)

Both oriented toward mastery, different directions. They're mastering understanding, you're mastering leadership. You need each other's opposite strengths.

### The Sage (Lore/Cozy)

Different missions, unlikely partnership. You're goal-focused, they're community-focused. Low compatibility unless you genuinely value each other's path.
