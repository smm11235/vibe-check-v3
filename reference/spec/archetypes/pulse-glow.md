# Pulse/Glow - The Main Character ⚡🔥

**Tagline:** The person who turns every night into a story.

## Your Vibe

You're the friend who makes going out a competitive sport - and you're winning. You've got energy that makes people feel alive just by being near you. You remember conversations, you know what's next, and somehow people just follow you. Going out isn't just what you do - it's what you do best.

You've got that chaotic, electric vibe that hits different. You notice the room's mood and you shift it. FOMO is real when you've already hit three places tonight. Your calendar is color-coded and you'll ditch all your plans if something better drops. You're not arrogant about it - you're just on a frequency most people are trying to match.

## At The Rooftop

Already planning which bar is next while everyone else is on round one.

## You vs Your Mirror Type: The Captain

You flip everything The Captain does. They turn goals into social events - you turn social events into personal wins. They're building accountability squads; you're bringing chaos to the party (the good kind). Same lightning energy, completely different direction. You'd be at the same place but for totally different reasons.

## Compatibility

### You (Pulse/Glow)

Same type - which means it either goes hard or goes sideways. You're both playing to win, so you either team up and take over or you're competing for the spotlight. If you sync, you're unstoppable. If you clash, it gets petty fast.

### The Golden Hour (Pulse/Cozy)

You love how they warm people up; they love how you energize the night. They'll ground you when you're running on empty, and you'll drag them into the spontaneous chaos they secretly want. Watch for: you bouncing before they're done connecting.

### The Tastemaker (Pulse/Lore)

Natural allies. They know where the good spots are, you know how to make them legendary. You're their access pass, they're your taste upgrade. You move fast, they're analyzing - make sure you're not leaving them behind.

### The Captain (Glow/Pulse)

Sibling energy but different targets. You're rallying people to the party, they're rallying people toward goals. You could dominate together but watch for them trying to make your fun "productive."

### The Anchor (Glow/Cozy)

They're building something slow and warm, you're chasing the rush. You might seem reckless to them (you're not), they might seem slow to you (also not true). Respect that they need rest - you need stimulation.

### The Optimizer (Glow/Lore)

You're both playing to win, just at different speeds. They're doing spreadsheets, you're doing instinct. You both care about winning - you've just got different definitions of it.

### The Host (Cozy/Pulse)

You're the chaos version of them. They're inviting people in, you're inviting people out. You'll make their gatherings unforgettable by showing up with energy.

### The Slow Burn (Cozy/Glow)

Very different pace. They're thinking three months ahead, you're thinking three hours from now. You might find them boring (don't), they might find you exhausting (maybe). Respect the difference.

### The Storyteller (Cozy/Lore)

You create chaos in motion, they create meaning in stillness. You might think they're passive, they might think you're surface. There's a gap here but it's not impossible.

### The Showrunner (Lore/Pulse)

They analyze everything, you live it. You're the one doing the thing they're geeking out about. They could be your hype person if you let them.

### The Completionist (Lore/Glow)

They're deep in research, you're already out living it. They might seem obsessive (productively), you might seem reckless (you're not). They need pushing, you need anchoring.

### The Sage (Lore/Cozy)

Quiet incompatibility. They make meaning in small spaces, you make chaos in big ones. Respect their world, don't expect them to join yours constantly.
