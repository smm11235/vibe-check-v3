# Pulse/Lore - The Tastemaker ⚡📚

**Tagline:** The person who always knows the best thing before anyone else.

---

## Your Vibe

You're out constantly and it shows - not in a flex way, just in how you move through the world with authority about what's good. You know the restaurant that's about to blow up, the DJ everyone will be obsessed with, the neighborhood that's becoming something. Your knowledge feels like you lived it, not studied it.

You're the social creature who's also deeply knowledgeable. While others are asking for recommendations, you're already two steps ahead, experiencing it, forming your take, and moving on. You don't gatekeep - you share. Your group chat is basically a masterclass in curation. You're not pretentious about it, just genuinely excited about good things and naturally good at finding them.

You operate on taste and instinct combined with real knowledge. You can feel when something's about to blow up. You're texting "we need to go here before it gets packed" and then six months later it does and you're already hunting the next spot. You're actively social and deeply informed. You experience things with full context. People follow you not for status but because you actually make their life better by showing them what's good.

Already scouting the next venue and definitely already researched it.

## You vs Your Mirror Type: The Showrunner

The Showrunner geeks out about social things - they host watch parties, make ranking websites, build community. You go out and experience things; they talk about the things worth experiencing. You're the explorer, they're the documenter.

## Compatibility

### The Main Character (Pulse/Glow)

Natural partnership with jealousy potential. You both own the scene differently - they win by presence, you win by knowing what's actually good. Together you're formidable. Watch for competing over who had the better idea.

### The Golden Hour (Pulse/Cozy)

Complementary energies. You bring taste, they bring warmth. You're discovering, they're connecting. You might move too fast for their deep connections, but together you make spots matter.

### You (Pulse/Lore)

Same type with high competition risk. You could pool knowledge and become ultimate tastemakers together, or you're both fighting over who discovered it first. Make sure you're celebrating each other's finds.

### The Captain (Glow/Pulse)

Different arenas but mutual respect possible. They're focused on growth, you're focused on discovery. Your knowledge is lived experience, theirs is strategic. Both valid.

### The Anchor (Glow/Cozy)

Different speeds. They're building slow growth, you're discovering new experiences. Moderate compatibility - you'll teach them what's new, they'll teach you to appreciate returning somewhere good.

### The Optimizer (Glow/Lore)

Kindred obsession with knowledge, different applications. They research the optimal path, you discover the lived path. Surprisingly good if you appreciate their research informs better discoveries.

### The Host (Cozy/Pulse)

You bring discoveries to their gathered space. You make their gatherings elevated. Watch for wanting to keep moving while they want to settle.

### The Slow Burn (Cozy/Glow)

Different paces and purposes. They build slow sustainable rituals, you constantly discover new things. You'll teach them there's always something new, they'll teach you to return to good things.

### The Storyteller (Cozy/Lore)

Both love knowledge, different expressions. They go deep in specific things, you go wide across experiences. Respect their depth, they'll respect that you're actually experiencing things.

### The Showrunner (Lore/Pulse)

Natural allies with interesting dynamics. They analyze the scene, you live it. They might want you to slow down and they analyze, watch for that. High compatibility if you value their deeper dive.

### The Completionist (Lore/Glow)

Both oriented toward mastery, different targets. You're externally focused on good experiences, they're internally focused on understanding. Moderate compatibility.

### The Sage (Lore/Cozy)

Both knowledgeable, very different scales. They go deep into specific rituals, you go wide across experiences. Moderate compatibility - you'll come, share knowledge, leave for somewhere else.
