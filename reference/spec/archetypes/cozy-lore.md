# Cozy/Lore - The Storyteller 🕯️📚

**Tagline:** You're building worlds, one perfectly chosen thing at a time.

---

## Your Vibe

Your bookshelf (or plant collection, or playlist, or kitchen) is intentional as hell. Everything tells a story about what matters to you. You're not just cozy - you're curated cozy. Comfort isn't about being nice, it's about being specific. You know the difference between a vibe and actual taste. When you invite someone over, they're stepping into something you designed on purpose. People come to you because you make beautiful living look effortless (even though it's not).

## At The Hearth

You showed up and quietly made the entire evening feel like it was designed specifically for this group, and somehow everyone noticed even though you barely said anything about it.

## You vs Your Mirror Type: The Sage

You and The Sage are both about knowledge and warmth, but coming from opposite directions. You build a curated world from things you love. They find emotional wisdom inside worlds they explore. You're the aesthetic. They're the feeling. Same intentionality - different angles.

---

## You Click With
- People who actually understand what taste is and isn't
- Folks who treat knowledge like an art form
- Anyone who gets that your space is how you show love

## You Clash With
- Minimalists who think curation is clutter
- People who see taste as snobbery
- Anyone uncomfortable with depth and layers

## Compatibility

### The Main Character (Pulse/Glow)
They're bright and always moving. They'll find your space fascinating but might not stay. You're offering something deep; they're collecting experiences. Cool dynamic if you're both okay with what that means.

### The Golden Hour (Pulse/Cozy)
They are warmth. You design it. They'll vibe with your space but might not get why every detail matters. You'll make their natural warmth actually beautiful. Together you're actually unstoppable.

### The Tastemaker (Pulse/Lore)
Oh this is it. You both care about taste but express it differently. They're out in the world naturally cool; you're carefully designing cool spaces. You'll understand each other's bookshelf, their playlists, why certain things matter. Chemistry.

### The Captain (Glow/Pulse)
They're all achievement; you're all being. They might see your curated world as something to escape instead of return to. But actually? Your space is exactly what they need. Let them find rest there.

### The Anchor (Glow/Cozy)
Kindred spirits in different ways. They're doing intentional growth; you're doing intentional aesthetics. You could teach each other that comfort can be both emotional and beautiful.

### The Optimizer (Glow/Lore)
They want efficiency; you want meaning. They might think your bookshelf is chaotic. You might think their spreadsheets miss the point. But you could actually learn from each other. Let them help you understand why you love what you love.

### The Host (Cozy/Pulse)
They create social spaces; you create curated ones. Kindred on comfort but different on intention. When you work together, you get spaces that are warm and beautiful. That's rare.

### The Slow Burn (Cozy/Glow)
They're building a life; you're building a world. Not opposites. Your aesthetics could frame their growth. Your rituals could become part of their journey. Real synergy if you both value what the other brings.

### You (Cozy/Lore)
Same type - double the curation, double the taste. You'll either build the most intentional shared space ever or argue about whose bookshelf arrangement is better. Stay collaborative, not competitive.

### The Showrunner (Lore/Pulse)
They're social with their knowledge; you're intimate with yours. They'll feel the depth of your space immediately. You might find them loud in your carefully arranged room. But they could introduce you to communities around your interests. Stay open.

### The Completionist (Lore/Glow)
They master knowledge through discipline; you explore it through taste. They might think you're unsystematic. You might think they miss the poetry. But you're both deep. You could have genuinely good conversations about this.

### The Sage (Lore/Cozy)
This is your mirror and it's warm. You're both building worlds of knowledge and comfort - just from different angles. You'll get each other immediately. You'll have long conversations. The risk: you become too insular. Push each other to stay curious about new worlds.
