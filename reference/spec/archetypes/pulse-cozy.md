# Pulse/Cozy - The Golden Hour ⚡🕯️

**Tagline:** The person who makes every room feel like home.

---

## Your Vibe

You're the extrovert with a soft center. You're out all the time, but you're not cold about it. While everyone else is playing social chess, you notice who's standing alone and pull them in. You turn a random Tuesday into something that matters just by showing up and actually caring.

Your superpower is being warm at scale. You can work a room and make each person feel seen. You remember random details about people - not because you're calculating, just because you cared. People are relieved to see you because you make everything better without even trying.

## At The Rooftop

## Compatibility

### The Main Character (Pulse/Glow)

You're the emotional intelligence they didn't know they needed. They want to win the night, you want to make it matter. You pull them toward depth, they pull you toward action.

### You (Pulse/Cozy)

Same type - which means you either amplify each other's warmth or you're stepping on each other's toes. Make sure you're actually real with each other, not just warm-but-distant. You both deserve real care too.

### The Tastemaker (Pulse/Lore)

You ground their knowledge, they elevate your instincts. They know why places are good, you make them feel good. Great pairing if you don't mind them explaining everything.

### The Captain (Glow/Pulse)

You're their emotional anchor, they're your accountability buddy. They rally people toward goals, you rally people toward connection. It works if you're aligned on what matters.

### The Anchor (Glow/Cozy)

Kindred spirits different styles. You're both warm, they're just slower. They're building long-term, you're creating instant connection. Both are valuable - respect the game they're playing.

### The Optimizer (Glow/Lore)

Different missions. They're optimizing, you're connecting. They might see your warmth as distraction, you might see their analysis as cold. Meet in the middle.

### The Host (Cozy/Pulse)

Natural alliance - you're both warm, just at different speeds. They invite in, you radiate out. You could be legendary together if you respect the difference.

### The Slow Burn (Cozy/Glow)

Both warm, both committed, different timelines. They're thinking weeks ahead, you're thinking this weekend. Make space for both rhythms.

### The Storyteller (Cozy/Lore)

Both warm, different intimacy levels. They go deep in small circles, you go wide with everyone. Both actually warm, not just performing it.

### The Showrunner (Lore/Pulse)

You're their emotional translator. They analyze everything, you feel it. They benefit from your warmth, you benefit from their depth.

### The Completionist (Lore/Glow)

Different depth orientations. They research deep, you relate wide. Their research IS their care language.

### The Sage (Lore/Cozy)

Both cozy, different scales. They're creating intimate rituals, you're creating widespread connection. Respect their boundaries - they don't want your huge friend group, and that's okay.
