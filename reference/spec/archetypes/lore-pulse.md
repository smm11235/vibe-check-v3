# Lore/Pulse - The Showrunner 📚⚡

**Tagline:** Your obsession becomes the event everyone's talking about.

---

## Your Vibe

You host watch parties. You run the DM campaigns. You're the one pulling everyone together because "you have to experience this WITH me." Your knowledge runs deep but your reach runs wide. You get that the best part of loving something is loving it with people. You're not gatekeeping your interests - you're inviting people in. Your enthusiasm is literally contagious. You turn your fandoms into communities, your obsessions into gatherings, your group chats into the place where everyone wants to be. Being a nerd around you feels like the most fun thing in the world.

## At The Lobby

You showed up with snacks, made a group chat, and by midnight everyone's committed to the next gathering.

## You vs Your Mirror Type: The Tastemaker

You and The Tastemaker are both social knowledge people, but different angles. They naturally have excellent taste and it just radiates. You take deep knowledge and intentionally build communities around it. They're magnets; you're organizers. They're naturally cool; you're actively creating cool spaces. Both matter. Yours is designed. Theirs is effortless.

## You Click With
- People who get excited and want to share it immediately
- Folks who treat fandom as community
- Anyone who understands that joy shared is joy multiplied

## You Clash With
- Loners who keep interests private
- People who find enthusiasm exhausting
- Folks who see organizing as needing attention

## Compatibility

### The Main Character (Pulse/Glow)
You're both high energy but different roles. They're the energy; you're organizing it. They'll love that you're creating spaces where they can shine. Just don't let them turn your event into their event. You're the producer. That's the role.

### The Golden Hour (Pulse/Cozy)
You both bring people together but differently. They do it naturally; you do it intentionally. They'll warm your events; you'll structure them. Sounds boring but it actually works - you need both pieces.

### The Tastemaker (Pulse/Lore)
This is literally your mirror and it's powerful. You're both social knowledge-sharers from slightly different angles. You'll understand each other immediately. You could collaborate brilliantly. Just watch that you're building together, not competing for spotlight.

### The Captain (Glow/Pulse)
They want to lead; you want to host. Different things. They might try to take over your events. Set the boundaries early about who's running what. A Captain who respects your domain? Actually incredible.

### The Anchor (Glow/Cozy)
They're steady; you're chaotic. They might find your events scattered. But they could ground you, help you think about sustainability, remind you that not every gathering needs to be huge. There's balance here.

### The Optimizer (Glow/Lore)
They want to optimize everything. You want to share knowledge through passion. They might try to "improve" your events and you'll resist. But actually let them help - efficiency means you're not exhausted. Listen to them.

### The Host (Cozy/Pulse)
You're both social but different modes. They do intimate dinners; you do communal events. You need each other - they teach you depth, you teach them breadth. Real potential for complementary partnership.

### The Slow Burn (Cozy/Glow)
They're quietly building; you're actively building community. You might find them passive. But if they care about something, they'll love how you make sharing it feel possible. You could pull them into communities around their interests.

### The Storyteller (Cozy/Lore)
You're both into knowledge and passion but expressing it differently. They build curated intimate worlds; you build social enthusiastic communities. They might feel you're too loud. You might feel they're not sharing enough. But you could work - they provide aesthetic, you provide audience.

### You (Lore/Pulse)
Same type - you'll either co-host the greatest events or fight over the spotlight. You both want to share knowledge socially. Make sure you're building together, not competing for the audience.

### The Completionist (Lore/Glow)
They master knowledge obsessively; you share it communally. They might think you're scattered. You might think they're rigid. But you both care deeply. Get them to one of your events and they'll love it - finally people who get it.

### The Sage (Lore/Cozy)
They go deep with emotional wisdom; you go wide with social energy. They might think you're missing depth. You might think they're not sharing widely enough. But you could teach each other - they teach meaning, you teach reach.
