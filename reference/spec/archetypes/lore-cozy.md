# Lore/Cozy - The Sage 📚🕯️

**Tagline:** You feel things through stories. Knowledge hits different when it hits your heart.

---

## Your Vibe

You cry at anime endings and write thoughtful reviews about books that understood you. Stories aren't just entertainment - they're mirrors. You go deep into knowledge because it matters to you, like actually moves you. You can talk for hours about why a character's arc devastated you or why a song made you realize something about yourself. Your wisdom comes from feeling your way through things, not just reading about them. When you find something you love, people feel that. They want to be around it. You're not collecting facts. You're collecting pieces of people you understand.

## At The Lobby

You're in the corner having a real conversation about what something meant, and somehow everyone gravitates because you make people feel less alone in what they feel.

## You vs Your Mirror Type: The Storyteller

You and The Storyteller are both warm and into knowledge, but from opposite angles. They're building cozy aesthetic worlds. You're finding emotional truths inside worlds that already exist. They're designing the space. You're being transformed by it. They're the curator. You're the mystic.

## Compatibility

### The Main Character (Pulse/Glow)
They perform for the world. You see through the performance to the actual person. That might scare them, but if you reach them, they'll feel genuinely seen. That's rare. Real potential if they let you in.

### The Golden Hour (Pulse/Cozy)
You both have warmth, just from different places. They're naturally kind. You're kind because you understand. This pairing is actually really nice. You might find them surface sometimes. They might find you heavy. But you're both good people.

### The Tastemaker (Pulse/Lore)
They share knowledge socially. You share it emotionally. They'll get your depth. You could introduce each other to new ways of thinking about stuff. Mutual respect play.

### The Captain (Glow/Pulse)
They're all about achievement. You're all about feeling. They might think you're getting in the way of their goals. You might think they're heartless. But you could ground them. That's actually what they need.

### The Anchor (Glow/Cozy)
Kindred energy. You both believe in something deeper than surface stuff. You're warm in similar ways. They could push you to grow. You could help them feel what they're building. Good balance.

### The Optimizer (Glow/Lore)
They use knowledge to improve systems. You use knowledge to understand hearts. They might think you're too emotional. You might think they're too robotic. But you're both thinkers. Could work if you respect each other's methods.

### The Host (Cozy/Pulse)
They gather people. You make people feel understood. Together you'd make things actually meaningful, not just fun. Real complementary energy.

### The Slow Burn (Cozy/Glow)
You're both warm and intentional about growth. You'll understand each other immediately. They might push you to grow. You might help them feel their growth instead of just tracking it.

### The Storyteller (Cozy/Lore)
This is your mirror - and it's warm. You'll get each other right away and have profound conversations. Watch out though - you could get so comfortable in your shared bubble that you forget the rest of the world exists. Stay curious.

### The Showrunner (Lore/Pulse)
They're excited about knowledge. You understand it emotionally. They might find you quiet. You might find them surface. But if they care about something, they'll respect the depth you bring and grow from it.

### The Completionist (Lore/Glow)
They master knowledge obsessively. You understand it emotionally. They might think you're not precise enough. You might think they're cold. But you're both devoted. Respect each other and you'll have real conversations. They teach you system. You teach them soul.

### You (Lore/Cozy)
Same type - you'll understand each other immediately and go deep fast. The risk is you create a bubble so comfortable neither of you wants to leave it. Keep pushing each other outward.
