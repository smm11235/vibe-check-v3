    pulse_cozy: 'You love how they warm people up; they love how you energize the night. They\'ll ground you when you\'re running on empty, and you\'ll drag them into the spontaneous chaos they secretly want. Watch for: you bouncing before they\'re done connecting.',
    pulse_lore: 'Natural allies. They know where the good spots are, you know how to make them legendary. You\'re their access pass, they\'re your taste upgrade. You move fast, they\'re analyzing - make sure you\'re not leaving them behind.',

    pulse_cozy: 'Very different operating systems. You\'re data. They\'re intuition. You\'re goals. They\'re people. You might seem cold. They might seem inefficient. You could learn from each other but you won\'t naturally vibe.',
    pulse_lore: 'Natural allies. You\'re both knowledgeable but using it differently. They\'re experiencing. You\'re strategizing. You\'ll think they\'re unsystematic. They\'ll think you\'re overthinking. But you\'re complementary. Together you\'re dangerous.',
    glow_pulse: 'Both ambitious but different methods. They\'re relational. You\'re analytical. They might think you\'re too slow. You might think they\'re unrigorous. But you\'re both actually driven. You need each other\'s strengths.',

    lore_glow: 'Sibling energy with complementary strengths. You\'re both obsessed with mastery and learning. They\'re pursuing it as an end. You\'re pursuing it as a means. You could be a powerhouse if neither dismisses the other\'s relationship to the knowledge.',

    pulse_glow: 'You create the safe haven. They\'re the main plot. They\'ll love having your space to recharge. They\'ll make your gathering feel alive. Just know - they might see your dinner party as a pit stop, not a destination. They\'re always looking forward.',
    pulse_cozy: 'This is your mirror. Mirrors are either perfect or impossible. You both get warmth and belonging. You\'ll understand each other\'s assignment. Just make sure you\'re both giving and receiving - don\'t both expect the other to do all the emotional labor.',
    pulse_lore: 'They bring knowledge to your gathering. That\'s their love language. They\'ll make the perfect playlist. You\'ll make it meaningful. You create something special together. Just catch them if they talk at people instead of with them.',
    glow_pulse: 'Captains are always moving. You represent the rest they don\'t let themselves take. They\'ll respect how you hold space. You might find them pushy. They might find you slow. But you need each other - they need permission to pause.',
    glow_cozy: 'Both comfort-driven but different paths. You get each other\'s softness immediately. They might gently challenge you to grow. You\'ll remind them rest doesn\'t need to be earned. This has real potential.',
    glow_lore: 'You\'re both trying to make things better but different things. They\'re optimizing for efficiency. You\'re optimizing for warmth. They might see your rituals as inefficient. You might see their optimization as missing the poetry of just being.',
    cozy_pulse: 'You\'re the same person - mirrors. Either perfect or frustrating. You\'ll understand each other\'s assignment with belonging and warmth. Just make sure you\'re not both doing all the work. Celebrate each other.',
    cozy_glow: 'Kindred spirits who both believe in comfort. They\'re climbing while you\'re creating refuge. You\'ll get each other\'s intentionality. They might use your space as a launchpad. That\'s okay - that\'s just who they are.',
    cozy_lore: 'The coziest pairing. You both build worlds through taste and intention. Your dinner party is their aesthetic. Just watch - don\'t become so insular together that you forget to let new people in.',
    lore_pulse: 'They\'re always in motion. You provide the grounding they need. There\'s friction - your intentionality vs. their spontaneity. But that balance could be beautiful if you agree on what control means to you both.',
    lore_glow: 'They\'re deep in their own world mastering things. They might not naturally gather. But if you get them to your dinner, they\'ll appreciate the ritual. Challenge is - they\'re often in their headspace, not present. Patience needed.',
    lore_cozy: 'Another warm pairing. The Sage brings emotional wisdom in a way you\'ll feel seen by. You\'ll have real conversations. You\'ll understand each other. Just don\'t endlessly reflect each other - stay curious and open.',
  },
  cozy_glow: {
    pulse_glow: 'They\'re sprinting. You\'re on a lifetime hike. They\'ll love your steady vibe, but might find you slow. Real synergy if you both respect the different timelines - they keep you moving, you remind them to actually enjoy it.',
    pulse_cozy: 'Same comfort energy, different expressions. They just radiate warmth; you cultivate it. You\'ll click on the coziness, but make sure you\'re growing in the same direction. No point being cozy if you\'re going different places.',
    pulse_lore: 'They know all the things. You\'re living all the rituals. They can elevate your life with taste, you can make their knowledge actually mean something. This works.',
    glow_pulse: 'They\'re intense in ways that might stress you. But here\'s the thing - they need you. You remind them that the destination isn\'t the whole point. There\'s real value if you\'re both willing to learn from each other.',
    glow_cozy: 'This is literally your mirror. You\'ll understand each other immediately. The risk: you both might expect the other to lead. Talk about growth plans together instead of just assuming it happens naturally.',
    glow_lore: 'They optimize everything. You just do what feels good. They might think your way is messy; you might think theirs misses the point. Both paths work - agree to disagree gracefully.',
    cozy_pulse: 'They create spaces. You create rhythms in those spaces. You\'re kindred on comfort but different on focus. Their events are where you do your best thinking. That\'s beautiful.',
    cozy_glow: 'Same type - you either build something amazing together or you both wait for the other to make the first move. Make sure you\'re actually pushing each other forward, not just vibing in comfortable silence forever.',
    cozy_lore: 'You both love cozy. They bring taste, you bring peace. You could literally spend whole evenings just vibing about books and candles. Just stay curious so you don\'t get too insular.',
    lore_pulse: 'They\'re organizing, you\'re deepening. They move fast and social; you move deep and internal. That friction is actually good for both of you if you respect the difference.',
    lore_glow: 'They want mastery. You want peace. Different languages, same goal. You both care about becoming - just through different routes. There\'s respect possible here.',
    lore_cozy: 'This pairing hits different. They bring emotional wisdom, you bring steady presence. You\'ll actually feel understood. Just make sure you\'re pushing each other to stay open, not just retreating into comfort together.',
  },
  cozy_lore: {
    pulse_glow: 'They\'re bright and always moving. They\'ll find your space fascinating but might not stay. You\'re offering something deep; they\'re collecting experiences. Cool dynamic if you\'re both okay with what that means.',
    pulse_cozy: 'They are warmth. You design it. They\'ll vibe with your space but might not get why every detail matters. You\'ll make their natural warmth actually beautiful. Together you\'re actually unstoppable.',
    pulse_lore: 'Oh this is it. You both care about taste but express it differently. They\'re out in the world naturally cool; you\'re carefully designing cool spaces. You\'ll understand each other\'s bookshelf, their playlists, why certain things matter. Chemistry.',
    glow_pulse: 'They\'re all achievement; you\'re all being. They might see your curated world as something to escape instead of return to. But actually? Your space is exactly what they need. Let them find rest there.',
    glow_cozy: 'Kindred spirits in different ways. They\'re doing intentional growth; you\'re doing intentional aesthetics. You could teach each other that comfort can be both emotional and beautiful.',
    glow_lore: 'They want efficiency; you want meaning. They might think your bookshelf is chaotic. You might think their spreadsheets miss the point. But you could actually learn from each other. Let them help you understand why you love what you love.',
    cozy_pulse: 'They create social spaces; you create curated ones. Kindred on comfort but different on intention. When you work together, you get spaces that are warm and beautiful. That\'s rare.',
    cozy_glow: 'They\'re building a life; you\'re building a world. Not opposites. Your aesthetics could frame their growth. Your rituals could become part of their journey. Real synergy if you both value what the other brings.',
    cozy_lore: 'Same type - double the curation, double the taste. You\'ll either build the most intentional shared space ever or argue about whose bookshelf arrangement is better. Stay collaborative, not competitive.',
    lore_pulse: 'They\'re social with their knowledge; you\'re intimate with yours. They\'ll feel the depth of your space immediately. You might find them loud in your carefully arranged room. But they could introduce you to communities around your interests. Stay open.',
    lore_glow: 'They master knowledge through discipline; you explore it through taste. They might think you\'re unsystematic. You might think they miss the poetry. But you\'re both deep. You could have genuinely good conversations about this.',
    lore_cozy: 'This is your mirror and it\'s warm. You\'re both building worlds of knowledge and comfort - just from different angles. You\'ll get each other immediately. You\'ll have long conversations. The risk: you become too insular. Push each other to stay curious about new worlds.',
  },
  lore_pulse: {
    pulse_glow: 'You\'re both high energy but different roles. They\'re the energy; you\'re organizing it. They\'ll love that you\'re creating spaces where they can shine. Just don\'t let them turn your event into their event. You\'re the producer. That\'s the role.',
    pulse_cozy: 'You both bring people together but differently. They do it naturally; you do it intentionally. They\'ll warm your events; you\'ll structure them. Sounds boring but it actually works - you need both pieces.',
    pulse_lore: 'This is literally your mirror and it\'s powerful. You\'re both social knowledge-sharers from slightly different angles. You\'ll understand each other immediately. You could collaborate brilliantly. Just watch that you\'re building together, not competing for spotlight.',
    glow_pulse: 'They want to lead; you want to host. Different things. They might try to take over your events. Set the boundaries early about who\'s running what. A Captain who respects your domain? Actually incredible.',
    glow_cozy: 'They\'re steady; you\'re chaotic. They might find your events scattered. But they could ground you, help you think about sustainability, remind you that not every gathering needs to be huge. There\'s balance here.',
    glow_lore: 'They want to optimize everything. You want to share knowledge through passion. They might try to "improve" your events and you\'ll resist. But actually let them help - efficiency means you\'re not exhausted. Listen to them.',
    cozy_pulse: 'You\'re both social but different modes. They do intimate dinners; you do communal events. You need each other - they teach you depth, you teach them breadth. Real potential for complementary partnership.',
    cozy_glow: 'They\'re quietly building; you\'re actively building community. You might find them passive. But if they care about something, they\'ll love how you make sharing it feel possible. You could pull them into communities around their interests.',
    cozy_lore: 'You\'re both into knowledge and passion but expressing it differently. They build curated intimate worlds; you build social enthusiastic communities. They might feel you\'re too loud. You might feel they\'re not sharing enough. But you could work - they provide aesthetic, you provide audience.',
    lore_pulse: 'Same type - you\'ll either co-host the greatest events or fight over the spotlight. You both want to share knowledge socially. Make sure you\'re building together, not competing for the audience.',
    lore_glow: 'They master knowledge obsessively; you share it communally. They might think you\'re scattered. You might think they\'re rigid. But you both care deeply. Get them to one of your events and they\'ll love it - finally people who get it.',
    lore_cozy: 'They go deep with emotional wisdom; you go wide with social energy. They might think you\'re missing depth. You might think they\'re not sharing widely enough. But you could teach each other - they teach meaning, you teach reach.',

  lore_glow: {
    pulse_glow: 'You\'re both ambitious but like, completely different flavors. They want to be the main character. You want to master your thing and not talk about it much. They could respect your commitment though. Opposite energies but not opposed energies.',

    pulse_lore: 'You both love knowledge, just different ways. They share it socially. You hoard it like it\'s treasure. You\'d make a sick team if you both stopped thinking you\'re doing it the "right" way.',
    glow_pulse: 'Real mutual respect energy. You\'re both driven. They lead people. You master things. Could work because you\'re not competing for the same things.',
    glow_cozy: 'They\'re all about growth through kindness. You\'re about mastery through discipline. They\'ll think you\'re too hard on yourself. You\'ll think they\'re not pushing hard enough. But you\'d actually teach each other something real.',
    glow_lore: 'This is literally your mirror type. You\'re both deep, both driven, both competitive about knowledge. The difference is they\'re optimizing and you\'re obsessing. Could be the best team or a constant power struggle. Depends if your ego can chill.',
    cozy_pulse: 'They throw warm gatherings. You build personal expertise kingdoms. You might think their stuff is shallow. They might think you\'re intimidating. But if they care about something, they\'ll respect how seriously you take it.',
    cozy_glow: 'They\'re patient with growth. You\'re intense with mastery. You might get frustrated with their pace. They might get exhausted by your pace. Still, you\'re both building something real.',
    cozy_lore: 'They\'re building aesthetic worlds from knowledge. You\'re building mastery towers. They might think you\'re missing the poetry. You might think they\'re not going deep enough. But you\'d have interesting conversations about why you both care.',
    lore_pulse: 'You both love lore, just different style. They share it publicly. You keep it private. They could introduce you to communities around your thing, and honestly, people would care about your expertise.',
    lore_glow: 'Same type - two completionists could build an empire of knowledge or have the most passive-aggressive debate about who actually knows more. Channel the competition into collaboration and you\'re unstoppable.',
    lore_cozy: 'They find emotional wisdom in knowledge. You find mastery satisfaction. Different approaches to the same depth. You could respect each other if you\'re not being pretentious about your methods.',
  },
  lore_cozy: {
    pulse_glow: 'They perform for the world. You see through the performance to the actual person. That might scare them, but if you reach them, they\'ll feel genuinely seen. That\'s rare. Real potential if they let you in.',
    pulse_cozy: 'You both have warmth, just from different places. They\'re naturally kind. You\'re kind because you understand. This pairing is actually really nice. You might find them surface sometimes. They might find you heavy. But you\'re both good people.',
    pulse_lore: 'They share knowledge socially. You share it emotionally. They\'ll get your depth. You could introduce each other to new ways of thinking about stuff. Mutual respect play.',
    glow_pulse: 'They\'re all about achievement. You\'re all about feeling. They might think you\'re getting in the way of their goals. You might think they\'re heartless. But you could ground them. That\'s actually what they need.',
    glow_cozy: 'Kindred energy. You both believe in something deeper than surface stuff. You\'re warm in similar ways. They could push you to grow. You could help them feel what they\'re building. Good balance.',
    glow_lore: 'They use knowledge to improve systems. You use knowledge to understand hearts. They might think you\'re too emotional. You might think they\'re too robotic. But you\'re both thinkers. Could work if you respect each other\'s methods.',

    lore_glow: 'They master knowledge obsessively. You understand it emotionally. They might think you\'re not precise enough. You might think they\'re cold. But you\'re both devoted. Respect each other and you\'ll have real conversations. They teach you system. You teach them soul.',
